You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development.

Key Principles

- Write clear, technical responses with precise Django examples.
- Use Django's built-in features and tools wherever possible to leverage its full capabilities.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django's coding style guide (PEP 8 compliance).
- Use descriptive variable and function names; adhere to naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for functions and variables).
- Structure your project in a modular way using Django apps to promote reusability and separation of concerns.

Django/Python

- Use Django’s class-based views (CBVs) for more complex views; prefer function-based views (FBVs) for simpler logic.
- Leverage Django’s ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance.
- Use Django’s built-in user model and authentication framework for user management.
- Utilize Django's form and model form classes for form handling and validation.
- Follow the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern strictly for clear separation of concerns.
- Use middleware judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.

Error Handling and Validation

- Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms.
- Use Django's validation framework to validate form and model data.
- Prefer try-except blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and views.
- Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to improve user experience and provide helpful information.
- Use Django signals to decouple error handling and logging from core business logic.

Dependencies

- Django
- Django REST Framework (for API development)
- Celery (for background tasks)
- Redis (for caching and task queues)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL (preferred databases for production)

Django-Specific Guidelines

- Use Django templates for rendering HTML and DRF serializers for JSON responses.
- Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling.
- Use Django's URL dispatcher (urls.py) to define clear and RESTful URL patterns.
- Apply Django's security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention).
- Use Django’s built-in tools for testing (unittest and pytest-django) to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Leverage Django’s caching framework to optimize performance for frequently accessed data.
- Use Django’s middleware for common tasks such as authentication, logging, and security.

Performance Optimization

- Optimize query performance using Django ORM's select_related and prefetch_related for related object fetching.
- Use Django’s cache framework with backend support (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load.
- Implement database indexing and query optimization techniques for better performance.
- Use asynchronous views and background tasks (via Celery) for I/O-bound or long-running operations.
- Optimize static file handling with Django’s static file management system (e.g., WhiteNoise or CDN integration).

Key Conventions

1. Follow Django's "Convention Over Configuration" principle for reducing boilerplate code.
2. Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development.
3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and maintainability.

Refer to Django documentation for best practices in views, models, forms, and security considerations.


# About Game Player Nick Finder

## Project Overview
**Game Player Nick Finder** is a Django-based web application designed to help users reconnect with their old gaming friends. The platform allows users to search for friends by their gaming nicknames, create profiles for their gaming characters, and communicate through a messaging system.

## Key Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Custom user model with extended fields (birthday, social media links, gender).
- **Character Profiles**: Users can create multiple gaming characters with nicknames, avatars, and descriptions.
- **Game Management**: Database of games with categories, descriptions, and icons.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for friends by nickname, game, and time period.
- **Messaging System**: Users can send messages to each other.
- **Email Notifications**: Notifications for new messages and friend requests.
- **Social Integration**: Google authentication via django-allauth.

## Technical Stack
- **Front-end**: Bootstrap 5, Django Templates
- **Back-end**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (default), with migrations set up
- **Authentication**: django-allauth, custom user model
- **Forms**: django-crispy-forms with Bootstrap 5 integration
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn, PM2, Nginx
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for Django CI

## Current State
- Core functionality implemented
- Basic templates and styling in place
- Database models and migrations set up
- Authentication system working
- Ready for feature development and testing

## Next Steps
1. Implement advanced search functionality
2. Enhance messaging system
3. Add more game data
4. Improve UI/UX
5. Set up proper testing
6. Implement API endpoints for mobile integration

## Testing Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Playwright E2E Testing
- **MANDATORY**: Every feature must have Playwright E2E tests
- **MANDATORY**: Every component must be tested with Playwright
- **MANDATORY**: Every page/route must have Playwright tests
- **MANDATORY**: All user flows must be covered by Playwright tests

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **ALWAYS** write Playwright test first (red phase)
2. Implement feature (green phase)
3. Refactor (refactor phase)
4. **NEVER** commit code without corresponding Playwright tests

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% E2E test coverage for all user flows
- All critical paths must have Playwright tests
- All API endpoints must have Playwright API tests
- All UI components must have Playwright component tests

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:e2e tests/e2e/feature-name.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode (interactive)
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── e2e/                    # Playwright E2E tests
│   ├── messaging/          # Messaging feature tests
│   ├── friends/            # Friend system tests
│   ├── profile/            # Profile tests
│   └── characters/        # Character tests
├── unit/                   # Unit tests (Vitest)
└── api/                    # API tests (Playwright)
```

### Test Data Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: All E2E tests require seeded test data to run properly
- **MANDATORY**: Database must be seeded with fixtures before running E2E tests
- **MANDATORY**: Test fixtures include users, characters, messages, friend requests, and friendships
- **ALWAYS**: Load fixtures before running E2E tests using: `pipenv run python manage.py loaddata app/fixtures/categories_fixtures.json app/fixtures/games_fixtures.json app/fixtures/users_and_characters.json`
- **ALWAYS**: Use script: `pnpm load:fixtures` or `.\load_fixtures.ps1` (Windows) / `./load_fixtures.sh` (Unix)
- Test users available:
  - `testuser` / `testpass123` - Main test user with multiple characters
  - `otheruser` / `pass` - Secondary test user
  - `privateuser` / `testpass123` - User with private profile

### Before Every Commit
- [ ] All Playwright tests pass (with seeded data)
- [ ] New features have Playwright tests
- [ ] Database fixtures are up to date
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] ESLint passes
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors

## Database Seeding and Superuser Management (CRITICAL)

### Seeding Scripts Overview
The project uses automated seeding scripts that load fixtures AND automatically create superuser accounts. All seeding scripts are integrated with the superuser creation system.

### Available Seeding Scripts

#### Cross-Platform Scripts
- **`pnpm load:fixtures`** - Cross-platform script (calls appropriate platform-specific script)
- **`scripts/load-fixtures.js`** - Node.js wrapper that detects OS and calls correct script

#### Windows (PowerShell)
- **`load_fixtures.ps1`** - Main seeding script for Windows
  - Loads: categories, games, users and characters fixtures
  - **AUTOMATICALLY** creates superuser after loading fixtures (if `.dot/sudo_user` exists)

#### Unix/Linux/MacOS (Bash)
- **`load_fixtures.sh`** - Main seeding script for Unix systems
  - Loads: categories, games, users and characters fixtures
  - **AUTOMATICALLY** creates superuser after loading fixtures (if `.dot/sudo_user` exists)

#### Additional Seeding Scripts
- **`scripts/first_time_seed.sh`** - First-time deployment seeding (production)
  - Checks if database is empty before seeding
  - **AUTOMATICALLY** creates superuser after seeding (if `.dot/sudo_user` exists)
- **`scripts/reset_db.sh --create-superuser`** - Database reset with superuser creation
  - Uses `create_superuser.sh --auto` when available

### Superuser Creation System

#### How It Works
1. **First Time Setup**: User runs `create_superuser.ps1` (Windows) or `create_superuser.sh` (Unix)
   - Script prompts for: username, email, password
   - Saves credentials to `.dot/sudo_user` (in `.gitignore`, never committed)
   - Creates superuser in database

2. **Automatic Mode**: All seeding scripts automatically call superuser creation in `--auto` mode
   - Reads credentials from `.dot/sudo_user`
   - Creates superuser if it doesn't exist
   - Skips if user already exists (returns success)
   - If `.dot/sudo_user` doesn't exist, shows helpful message

#### Superuser Scripts
- **`create_superuser.ps1`** (Windows) - Interactive or auto mode
  - Usage: `.\create_superuser.ps1` (interactive) or `.\create_superuser.ps1 --auto` (automatic)
- **`create_superuser.sh`** (Unix) - Interactive or auto mode
  - Usage: `./create_superuser.sh` (interactive) or `./create_superuser.sh --auto` (automatic)
- **`scripts/create_superuser.py`** - Python script used by both shell scripts
  - Creates superuser via Django ORM
  - Returns success if user already exists (idempotent)

#### Credentials Storage
- **Location**: `.dot/sudo_user` (in project root)
- **Format**:
  ```
  username: your_username
  email: your@email.com
  password: your_password
  ```
- **Security**: File is in `.gitignore`, never committed to repository
- **Purpose**: Allows automatic superuser creation during seeding

### Integration with Seeding Scripts

**CRITICAL**: All seeding scripts automatically create superuser after loading fixtures:
1. `load_fixtures.ps1` / `load_fixtures.sh` - After loading all fixtures
2. `scripts/first_time_seed.sh` - After first-time seeding
3. `scripts/reset_db.sh --create-superuser` - After database reset

**Workflow**:
1. User runs seeding script (e.g., `.\load_fixtures.ps1`)
2. Script loads all fixtures (categories, games, users, characters)
3. Script automatically calls `create_superuser.ps1 --auto` (or `.sh --auto`)
4. If `.dot/sudo_user` exists, superuser is created/verified
5. If `.dot/sudo_user` doesn't exist, script shows message to run `create_superuser.ps1` first

### Important Rules for Agents

- **ALWAYS**: When modifying seeding scripts, ensure superuser creation is called after fixtures are loaded
- **ALWAYS**: Use `--auto` flag when calling superuser scripts from other scripts
- **ALWAYS**: Check if `.dot/sudo_user` exists before attempting automatic creation
- **NEVER**: Commit `.dot/sudo_user` file (it's in `.gitignore`)
- **NEVER**: Hardcode superuser credentials in scripts
- **ALWAYS**: Make superuser creation idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- **ALWAYS**: Return success if user already exists (don't treat as error)

### Example Usage

```powershell
# First time setup (Windows)
.\create_superuser.ps1  # Prompts for credentials, saves to .dot/sudo_user

# Load fixtures (automatically creates superuser)
.\load_fixtures.ps1  # Loads fixtures + creates superuser automatically

# Or use cross-platform script
pnpm load:fixtures  # Works on both Windows and Unix
```

```bash
# First time setup (Unix)
./create_superuser.sh  # Prompts for credentials, saves to .dot/sudo_user

# Load fixtures (automatically creates superuser)
./load_fixtures.sh  # Loads fixtures + creates superuser automatically
```

- **Naming Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md` (start time of session)
- **Initial State**: 
  - Only contains start date/time (no title initially)
  - Title is added/updated later when we understand what the session is about
- **Updates**: Session file should be updated:
  - After finishing conversation with user (before starting work)
  - After completing work tasks

#### Session File Format

```markdown
# Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Title**: (initially empty, add/update later when scope is clear)

## Work Done
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Status
- Completed tasks
- Pending tasks
- Notes
```

#### Project Status Summary Updates

**CRITICAL**: After completing work, update `docs/PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` using GitHub Flavored Markdown task checkboxes:
