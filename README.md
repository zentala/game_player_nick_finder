## üèó Current & Planned App Architecture
### Current Backend: [Django Full-Stack App in `server` Directory](https://github.com/zentala/game_player_nick_finder/tree/master/server)
- Our current setup uses Django for server-side rendering, efficiently delivering static content and managing server-client interactions.
- Django's ORM is integral for database interactions, while Django Views handle business logic and data presentation.

#### Planned Transition to API-Driven Architecture
- The next phase involves shifting to Django REST Framework for API endpoints creation, setting the stage for a more dynamic, interactive frontend.
- These API endpoints will be consumed by a [Planned React.js Client](https://github.com/zentala/game_player_nick_finder/tree/master/client) for enhanced user experiences.

### Planed initial [Future React.js Client in `client` directory](https://github.com/zentala/game_player_nick_finder/tree/master/client)
- Contains the foundational setup for the future React.js application, awaiting development post-API integration.

### Current Development Focus
1) The immediate goal is to achieve MVP functionality, including character creation flows, friend search optimization, and user account panels for game and character management.
2) Current priorities include contact information sharing, friend request features, and notification systems for new user additions.
3) Long-term plans include implementing a user-to-user chat system.
4) The React.js development is deferred for now, focusing instead on completing the business logic and core functionalities.
